## Harvard Courses Web Scraper

This project is a Python-based web scraper that extracts course titles, descriptions, subjects, modalities (Online/In-Person), and links from Harvard Online Courses. It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the webpage and Pandas to store the scraped data into a CSV file.

After running the script, the extracted data is:
✅ Saved in harvard_courses.csv
✅ Displayed in a clean table format in the terminal

This is useful for:
✔️ Analyzing Harvard's online course offerings
✔️ Filtering courses based on subject or modality
✔️ Collecting data for research or academic purposes
